# Geographic Distribution of Immigrants in Canada

## Introduction

This code is a part of a personal project where I challenged myself to visualize the distribution of immigrants in Canada using two new tools: Adobe Illustrator and Tableau. The R Markdown file illustrates how the data was prepared in R.

### Tools/Technologies

-   R

## Description

In this project, I clean and analyze the 2016 Canadian Census dataset to visualize the distribution of immigrants in Canada. The Canadian Census dataset is one in which I explore often as it is a large dataset with so many variables which means there are plenty of insights to discover!

I focused on the distribution of immigrants as I was inspired by a course project where I looked at the immigrant wage gap. I was curious to find out: (1) Where does the majority of immigrants live? and (2) Where are the majority of immigrants from? After cleaning the data, I summarized the data to find the distribution of immigrants (in percentage).

## How to use this repo

The data, 2016 Canadian Census dataset, used in this project is a Public Use Microdata File (PUMF). This means it's an exception to the Statistics Canada Open Licence agreement and therefore, cannot be made available publicly. Unfortunately, this also means you won't be able to run my code without any errors. Nonetheless, I've included my code [here](https://github.com/heatherpham/georgraphic-distribution-of-immigrants/blob/main/georgraphic-distribution-of-immigrants.rmd) for your viewing.
